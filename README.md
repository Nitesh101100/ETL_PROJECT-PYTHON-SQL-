ETL is the foundation of data-driven decision-making. Without it, data remains messy and unstructured, making it hard to extract valuable insights. ETL ensures that data is:
1️⃣ Extracted from various sources.
2️⃣ Transformed into a clean, structured format.
3️⃣ Loaded into a destination ready for analysis.
It’s the backbone of any data project, helping turn raw data into meaningful insights.
